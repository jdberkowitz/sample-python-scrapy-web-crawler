# Python Web Script for crawling NSL lighting website for product data
I used scripts like these all the time to parse vendor data from ecommerce websites. This script parses a site and outputs a nicely formatted csv to upload to our shopping platform.

#Python and scrapy offer a powerful way to retreive data online. 

#Getting Started

First you will want to install scrapy. If you are on windows the easiest way is to 
install Anaconda and then follow the scrappy command line instructions to install and setup a new project. 

This can be done witht he following commands when Anaconda is installed
[code]conda install -c conda-forge scrapy[/code]
